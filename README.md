### Hey! 👋

I graduated from The University of Manchester with a Master of Engineering in Computer Science in 2015. Since then, I've worked as a backend engineer in the fintech industry, designing, building and maintaining enterprise applications and services in Java and Go.

I'm also a great outdoors enthusiast ⛰, cyclist 🚲, runner 🏃‍♂️ and somewhat, a coffee snob ☕️. On most days, you can also find me fiddling with my camera 📷 or my guitar 🎸.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my [personal profile web page](https://github.com/bgguna/profile).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to build web applications end-to-end.
