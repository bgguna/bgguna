### Hey! 👋

I graduated from The University of Manchester with a Master of Engineering in Computer Science in 2015. Since then, I've been working as a backend engineer in the fintech industry, designing, building and maintaining enterprise applications and services in Java and Go.

I'm also a great outdoors enthusiast ⛰, climber 🧗‍♂️, cyclist 🚲, runner 🏃‍♂️ and a coffee snob ☕️. On most days, you can also find me fiddling with my camera 📷.

- 📖 I’m currently learning how to build iOS apps.
